## Requirements for Successful Development:

**Technical Skills:**

* **Mobile App Development:** Proficiency in a framework like React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.
* **API Development:** Experience with server-side technologies like Node.js or Python and frameworks like Express.js or Django for building robust APIs.
* **Database Management:** Understanding of SQL and experience working with Microsoft SQL Server databases.
* **Security:** Knowledge of secure coding practices, user authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

**Non-Technical Skills:**

* **Problem-Solving:** Ability to analyze user needs and translate them into technical solutions.
* **Communication:** Effective communication with stakeholders like Utibu health staff to understand their requirements.
* **Project Management:** Skills to plan, organize, and track development progress.

**Software and Tools:**

* **Mobile App Development Environment:** A development environment suitable for your chosen framework (e.g., Android Studio for native Android development or a code editor with React Native or Flutter plugins).
* **API Development Environment:** A code editor and terminal suitable for your chosen server-side technology (e.g., Visual Studio Code for Node.js development).
* **Database Management Tools:** Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or other tools for interacting with the SQL Server database.
* **Version Control System:** Git for version control and collaboration.

**Environments:**

* **Development Environment:** A local machine or cloud environment for setting up your development tools and running the mobile app and API server during development.
* **Testing Environment:** A separate environment (ideally a staging environment) to test the app and API thoroughly before deployment to production.
* **Production Environment:** A cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure) or a dedicated server to host the mobile app and API server for real-world usage by Utibu health patients.


## Step-by-Step Development Guide:

1. **Planning and Design:**
    * Define user stories and functionalities.
    * Design the user interface (UI) for the mobile app.
    * Design the API endpoints for interaction between the mobile app and server.
2. **Development:**
    * Develop the mobile app frontend using your chosen framework.
    * Develop the API server backend using your chosen server-side technology.
    * Implement functionalities like user login, medication browsing, order placement, and order status checks.
    * Integrate the mobile app with the API server using secure API calls.
    * Connect the API server to the existing Microsoft SQL Server database using appropriate drivers.
3. **Testing:**
    * Conduct unit testing for both the mobile app and API functionalities.
    * Perform integration testing to ensure seamless communication between the app and server.
    * Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with representative users from Utibu health to gather feedback and ensure the app meets their needs.
4. **Deployment:**
    * Deploy the mobile app to the respective app stores (Google Play Store for Android, App Store for iOS).
    * Deploy the API server to a production environment (cloud or dedicated server).
    * Configure the mobile app to connect to the deployed API server endpoint.
5. **Maintenance and Support:**
    * Monitor the app and server performance for any issues.
    * Address bug reports and implement new features based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

**Installation (Mobile App):**

Once the mobile app is deployed to the app stores, users can install it on their devices by searching for the app name in the respective app store and following the installation instructions.


## Additional Notes:

* This is a high-level guide, and the specific steps may vary depending on your chosen technologies and tools.
* Security considerations are crucial throughout the development process. Implement secure coding practices, user authentication, and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.
* Consider scalability from the beginning to accommodate future growth in the number of users and medication orders.

By following these steps and addressing the requirements, you can successfully develop and deploy the mobile app for Utibu health, improving patient convenience and pharmacy efficiency.
